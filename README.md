# Show My Location App (Assignment #6)

## The Synopsis

This "Show My Location" app is a pretty straightforward iOS app that's developed in Swift, and I used the Core Location and MapKit frameworks. It's designed to show the user's current location on a map, together with their latitude, longitude, and altitude details shown in the text fields. When the user grants permission, the app gets and updates these details in real-time, giving a clear and concise visualization of the user's geographical position.

### Features
- Real-time location tracking.
- Display of current latitude, longitude, and altitude.
- Map view showing the user's location with zoom capabilities.

### Technologies Used
- **Swift:** The main programming language for the app.
- **Core Location:** A framework used to get the geographical location and orientation of the device.
- **MapKit:** A framework used for embedding maps directly into views.

### Application Flow
1. **Permission Request:** On launch, the app asks for the user's permission to access their location.
2. **Location Display:** Once permission is given, the app displays the user's current location, including latitude, longitude, and altitude, in the designated text fields.
3. **Map Visualization:** The user's location is also pinpointed on a map view, with the capability to zoom in and out for a better geographical perspective.

### Prerequisites
To use the "Show My Location" app, you need:
- An iOS device or simulator running iOS 14 or later.
- Xcode 12 or later for development and testing.

### Author
- This project was made by me as part of my programming assignment (Assignment #6).
